-- /writworthy auto: "Oopening writs..." show N/M how many in bag for progress
-- Why no auto-disconnect from station after last crafting?
-- Why 1st several stations no HSM indicator? Did I exceed some limit?
-- Would like a writ count at bottom of WW window, along with other summary numbers



A better way to find skill lines for the 7 crafting skills

* GetCraftingSkillLineIndices(*[TradeskillType|#TradeskillType]* _craftingSkillType_)

** _Returns:_ *[SkillType|#SkillType]* _skillType_, *luaindex* _skillLineIndex_

2018-07-30 3D indicator over "next crafting station"

From HarvestMap: a ton of libraries. Which do I really need?

Lib3D by Shinni
    http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1664-Lib3D.html
    LibGPS2 required
    LibMapPing required
    Seems to handle scale factors for maps, coord/meter conversion
    Lacks scale info for player housing, but probably could be added easily.
    "HousingWorld" vs. "PersistenWorld or just 'World'"
    Origin is NW corner with increasing values of X,Z going East, South

LibGPS by Sirinsidiator, votan
    aka LibGPS2
    LibMapPing required
    maps and waypoints and map clicks
    local/zone/global X,Y conversions

Not sure we HAVE to use any of this if we're in HousingWorld, where coordinates are in centimeters and the origin never changes out from under us as the player moves about (unlike in the full world, where the origin resets to player position every 1km)

HarvestMap/InRangePins.lua
    is where the worldMarker.dds texture is loaded

function InRangePins:GetNewWorldControl(
      pinTypeId
    , globalX
    , globalY
    , worldZ
    , version
    )

    pin / beam / icon

    beam:Create3DRenderSpace()
    beam:Set3DRenderSpaceOrigin(x,y,z)
    beam:Set3DLocalDimensions(width,height)

    ^ These are ZOS functions for controls

GetNumSmithingTraitItems() → 34

Weird
GetSmithingResearchLineTraitDescriptions(
      number TradeskillType craftingSkillType
    , number researchLineIndex
    , number traitIndex
    )
Returns:
    string traitDescription
    , string traitResearchSourceDescription
    , string traitMaterialSourceDescription
No "Nirnhoned" or anything useful like that.
"Increases healing done". Yawn

GetSmithingTraitItemInfo(ITEM_TRAIT_TYPE_ARMOR_DIVINES + 1)
    1     Search on ESOUI Source Code GetSmithingTraitItemInfo(number traitItemIndex)
        Returns: number:nilable ItemTraitType traitType, string itemName, textureName icon, number sellPrice, boolean meetsUsageRequirement, number itemStyleId, number ItemQuality quality


Nope: ITEM_TRAIT_TYPE_ARMOR_DIVINES → link to Garnet
    Uh wait, Garnet isn't Divines. Need to +1. Ugh.

GetSmithingTraitItemLink(number traitItemIndex + 1, number LinkStyle linkStyle)
        Returns: string link

GetHighestItemStyleId()  → 86
